# Sportlight – AI-Powered Grassroots Sports Talent Discovery Platform

## 1. Project Overview

Sportlight is an AI-driven platform designed to identify, evaluate, and promote grassroots sports talent across India, particularly from Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural regions. The platform enables athletes to digitally showcase their performance and receive objective, data-driven insights, reducing geographic and socioeconomic barriers in sports scouting.

Our mission is to democratize access to sports opportunities by leveraging Artificial Intelligence to ensure talent is recognized based on performance rather than location or connections.

## 2. Problem Statement

India has a vast pool of untapped sports talent in rural and semi-urban regions. However:

- Talent identification is largely manual and subjective.
- Scouting opportunities are concentrated in metropolitan areas.
- Athletes from smaller towns lack visibility and structured feedback.
- There is no centralized digital platform for grassroots sports discovery.
- Performance evaluation is often inconsistent and biased.

As a result, many capable athletes fail to receive the exposure and guidance required to advance professionally.

## 3. Objectives

The primary objectives of Sportlight are:

- Provide a digital platform for athletes to showcase their skills.
- Use AI-based analysis to generate objective performance metrics.
- Enable scouts and coaches to discover talent efficiently.
- Reduce regional and economic disparities in sports scouting.
- Build a scalable system that supports Bharat-scale deployment.
